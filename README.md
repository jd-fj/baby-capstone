I built out the tutorial show here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQyrwxMPm88&ab_channel=Fireship

In trying to move the firebase config out of the App.js, it all fell apart and became engulfed in flames. I warmed myself near the fire and built a static site to feel like I was accomplishing something. 

Questions moving forward: 
-How will I allow users to make new chats?
-What state will I need to store in Redux? Do I need redux? 
-How would I refactor the redux-help-queue to use Firestore but not Redux?
